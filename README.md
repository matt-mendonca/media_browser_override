media_browser_override
======================

This Drupal 7 module overrides (as cleanly as possible) some of Media 2's media browser WYSIWYG plugin functionality:
- Default to WYSIWYG display format
- Skip view mode form in the media browser
- Alter media browser plugin js
  - Allows you to use the selected text in the WYSIWYG as the media link text
  - Media Browser, by default, always uses the file name as the media link text
